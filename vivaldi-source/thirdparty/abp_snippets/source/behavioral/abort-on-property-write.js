/**
 * @description Patches a property on the window object
 * to abort execution when the property is written.
 *
 * No error is printed to the console.
 *
 * The idea originates from
 * [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/blob/80b195436f8f8d78ba713237bfc268ecfc9d9d2b/filters/resources.txt#L1671).
 * @memberof module:snippets/behavioral
 *
 * @param {string} property The name of the property.
 * @param {?string} setConfigurable Value of the configurable attribute. Sets
 * the flag to false if "false" is given, the flag is set to true
 * for all other cases.
 * @example
 * abort-on-property-write adHandler.cmd.push => The code that
 * sets the push function throws an exception. This function is
 * a property of cmd, witch is a property of adHandler global object.
