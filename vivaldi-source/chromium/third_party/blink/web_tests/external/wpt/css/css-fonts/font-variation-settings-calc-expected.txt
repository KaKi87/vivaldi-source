  assert_not_equals: property should be set got disallowed value ""
[FAIL] e.style['font-variation-settings'] = "\\"wght\\" sibling-index()" should set the property value
  assert_not_equals: property should be set got disallowed value ""
[FAIL] Property font-variation-settings value '"wght" sign(1em - 1px)'
