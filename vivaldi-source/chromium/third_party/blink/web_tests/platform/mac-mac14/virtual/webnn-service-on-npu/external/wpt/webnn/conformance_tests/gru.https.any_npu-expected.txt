[FAIL] gru float32 tensors steps=2 with options.bias, options.recurrentBias, options.direction='both' and options.returnSequence=true
  assert_true: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test gru float32 actual -2.213313102722168 should be close enough to expected -2.213315725326538 by the acceptable 6 ULP distance, but they have 11 ULP distance expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
